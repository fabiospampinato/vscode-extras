# VSCode Extras

A collection of utilities for developing vscode extensions.

```

#### `getActiveFilePath`

```ts
import {getActiveFilePath} from 'vscode-extras';

const filePath = getActiveFilePath ();
```

#### `getActiveBinaryFilePath`

Get the path of the currently active binary file, where binary means the file is not being edited with a textual editor.

```ts
import {getActiveBinaryFilePath} from 'vscode-extras';

const filePath = getActiveBinaryFilePath ();
```

#### `getActiveTextualFilePath`

```ts
import {getConfig} from 'vscode-extras';

const config = getConfig ( 'myExtension' );
```

#### `getGitRootPath`

Infer the path of the nearest git repository, considering the currently open file also.

const rootPath = getGitRootPath ();
```

#### `getProjectRootPath`

Infer the root path of the current project, considering the currently open file also.

```ts
import {getProjectRootPath} from 'vscode-extras';

const rootPath = getProjectRootPath ();
```

#### `getProjectRootPaths`

Get all the root paths that make up the current workspace.

```ts
import {getProjectRootPaths} from 'vscode-extras';

const rootPaths = getProjectRootPaths ();
